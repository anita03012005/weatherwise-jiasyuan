Title: Build get_weather_data with wttr
Date: 2025-10-02

Me: I need a simple get_weather_data(location, forecast_days=5) using wttr.in JSON.
AI: Use requests to call https://wttr.in/{location}?format=j1 and parse current_condition and weather arrays.
Me: Please clamp forecast_days to 1..5 and handle timeouts gracefully.
AI: I added min max clamp and try except with a friendly message if response fails.
Me: Good. Include current temp, feels like, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and precipitation in current.
AI: Done. I also structured forecast as a list of dicts with date, min_temp_c, avg_temp_c, max_temp_c, humidity, wind_kmph, precip_mm.

Title: Normalize DataFrame columns for charts and agent
Date: 2025-10-09

Me: My charts and agent expect min_temp_c avg_temp_c max_temp_c precip_mm wind_kmph humidity. My data has min_temp max_temp precipitation{amount} wind{speed}.
AI: Add a forecast_to_df that renames columns and extracts nested fields to match the expected names.
Me: Please compute avg_temp_c from min and max if avg is missing.
AI: Added avg_temp_c = (min_temp_c + max_temp_c) / 2. Also convert date to pandas datetime.
Me: After this change my charts render and the agent summary works.
AI: Great. The normalised columns keep the rest of the app stable.

Title: Parse natural questions for time and attribute
Date: 2025-10-15

Me: I need parse_weather_question that extracts time today tomorrow week and attributes temperature rain wind humidity. Also capture location with "in Perth".
AI: Use small keyword maps and a regex like (?:in|for|at)\s+([A-Za-z\s\-]+)$ to capture the trailing location.
Me: Return a dict {location, time, attribute} with defaults time=week and attribute=None.
AI: Implemented. It works for "Will it rain this week in Perth" and "temperature tomorrow in Taipei".
Me: Good. I will pass the parsed result to run_simple_agent to generate a short answer.

Title: Console interface loop and charts
Date: 2025-10-18

Me: I want a console menu with options current weather forecast charts ask question change location exit.
AI: I wired a loop that calls display_current_weather display_forecast show_charts and run_simple_agent.
Me: Ensure matplotlib shows the figures in Colab. Add plt.show for each chart.
AI: Added plt.show in both create_temperature_visualisation and create_precipitation_visualisation.
Me: Tested 1 2 3 4 with city Perth. Output looks correct.

Title: Wrong column advice then corrected
Date: 2025-10-23

Me: My temp chart fails after I add avg. Why
AI (incorrect): Your DataFrame already has avg_temp_c by default.
Me: It does not. Columns are min_temp max_temp only. No avg_temp_c.
AI: You are right. Add avg_temp_c in forecast_to_df or compute it as (min_temp_c + max_temp_c) / 2. Then plot min avg max.
Me: I added the column and the three line plot works.
